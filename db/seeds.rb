# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# rooms = Room.create([{ number: 101, floor: 1, room_type: '1Bed', status: 'Clean' }, { number: 202, floor: 2, room_type: '2Bed', status: 'Dirty' }])
